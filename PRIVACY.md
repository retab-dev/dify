## Privacy Policy

**1. Introduction**
Your privacy is important. This document explains how our service handles user data when you upload documents for AI parsing using OpenAI or Gemini.

**2. Data We Collect**
We **do not** collect any personal identifiers such as names, emails, IP addresses, or device information. The only data processed is the **content of the documents you upload**.

* **Direct identifiers:** None collected.
* **Indirect identifiers:** None collected.
* **Intrinsic data:** We do not infer or store metadata (age, gender, occupation, etc.) from your documents.

**3. How We Use your Data**
The textual content you provide is solely used to perform AI parsing tasks. This data is:

* Sent securely to OpenAI or Gemini via their API.
* Processed in real time.
* Not stored, logged, or kept after parsing completes.

**4. Third‑Party Services**
We rely on OpenAI and/or Gemini as AI processing engines. Please refer to [OpenAI’s Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy) and [Google Gemini’s Privacy Policy](https://cloud.google.com/privacy) for details on how they handle data. No additional third-party services are used.

**5. Data Sharing**
We do not share your document contents with any external parties. The data is transmitted directly and securely to the AI provider and returns parsed results, nothing else.

**6. Data Retention & Deletion**
We do not store your document content. Once processed and returned, the data is immediately discarded.

**7. Security Measures**
We implement strong encryption via HTTPS/TLS in transit. We regularly review and update protocols to ensure data is securely transmitted to our AI partners.

**8. User Rights**
Since we don’t store or collect your data, there is no personal data to access, modify, export, or delete. Document privacy is inherently preserved by not storing content.

**9. Changes to This Policy**
We may update this notice for compliance or clarity. Please check back for the latest version and effective date.
